# Melon üçà

A Gleam library for running test containers via Docker.

Melon is inspired by [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) and provides an API to configure, start and stop
containers.

In contrast to other libraries, Melon doesn't use the [Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/), but
simply searches for and uses the `docker` executable. This makes the
[discovery methods](https://java.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/#docker-environment-discovery) used by
other libraries unnecessary. You can still use a remote Docker Engine by
[configuring a context](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/ssh) accordingly.

This approach also makes it possible to support all non-browser targets (Erlang, Bun, Deno, and Node.js) without further
dependencies, as consumers of this library don't need to reach for a target-specific client like
[fetch](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_fetch/) and [httpc](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_httpc/) in order to communicate with the
Docker Engine API.

## Maintenance Notice üçà

As of the 11th of August 2024, I won't be maintaining this project any longer.

I don't invest time in Gleam anymore, as I encountered too many breaking changes within minor version bumps, and too
many packages on Hex, which have been released as a first major version (1.0.0) without being battle-tested first, thus
being prone to breaking API changes or unexpected behavior.

I wish Gleam all the best, but I revert to other (enterprise-y) languages I'm already used to.

If you depend on Melon and/or want to maintain it, feel free to get in touch with me. I'd be willing to transfer the
ownership of this repository and the package on Hex. No need to create a fork :v:

## Demo üçà

```gleam
import gleam/int
import gleam/io
import melon/container.{Megabyte, Port, Second, Tcp}

pub fn main() {
  let start_result =
    container.new("postgres:16.3-alpine3.20")
    |> container.set_memory_limit(limit: 256, unit: Megabyte)
    |> container.set_health_check_command(["pg_isready", "-d", "morty_smith"])
    |> container.set_health_check_interval(interval: 2, unit: Second)
    |> container.set_health_check_timeout(timeout: 5, unit: Second)
    |> container.set_health_check_start_period(start_period: 2, unit: Second)
    |> container.set_health_check_retries(10)
    |> container.add_exposed_port(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 5432, protocol: Tcp)
    |> container.add_env(name: "POSTGRES_USER", value: "postgres")
    |> container.add_env(name: "POSTGRES_DB", value: "morty_smith")
    |> container.add_env(name: "POSTGRES_PASSWORD", value: "rick_sanchez")
    |> container.start()

  case start_result {
    Error(_) -> io.println("Couldn't start the container :(")
    Ok(container) ->
      case container.wait_until_healthy(container, retries: 10) {
        Error(_) -> io.println("The container is unhealthy ._.")
        Ok(_) ->
          case container.mapped_port(container, port: 5432, protocol: Tcp) {
            Error(_) -> io.println("Couldn't find the mapped port :<")
            Ok(Port(host, port, _)) ->
              io.println(
                "The database is available on "
                <> host
                <> ":"
                <> int.to_string(port)
                <> ".",
              )
          }
      }
  }
}
